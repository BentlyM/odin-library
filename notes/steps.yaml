current bugs : 
- theres a bug when a values other then letters are included will till be stored in the array in places that are unexpected
- bug where cards end at 29 instead of 30

current working on :
- trying to find a way to add object content to the card content variable and display it 
    - idea ->
        - i think maybe creating a separate function
        - display the values in javascript 
        - style it in css if any issues try in javascript (what?)
        - calling on the function generate the content


- future functionality :
    - add the delete button
    - add if we completed the book or not (read, not read)
    - if read turn the book green or some other color
    - we would need to update the card number there a chance that the card will just skip the number that was deleted in ascending order.

- resolved:
- bug where input values do not clear once inputted
- bug where you dropdown would not close unless you clicked add book
